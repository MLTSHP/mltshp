      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <h2 id="what_is_mltshp">What is going on here?</h2>
      <p>
        MLTSHP is an approximate clone of the much-loved site MLKSHK created by Andre and Amber
        which <a href="http://waxy.org/2017/04/closing-communities-ffffound-vs-mlkshk/">closed
        in April of 2017</a>. We are 100% community funded and member-run. The site is
        subscription-based and is owned by a non-profit, the <a href="https://www.librarian.net/massmas/">Massachusetts Mutual Aid Society</a>. Member contributions and occasional fundraisers pay for this site. </p>
        
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/MLTSHP/mltshp">The
        code is on Github</a> along with <a href="https://github.com/MLTSHP/welcome">a welcome
        module there</a> which talks about what is going on. There is also a Slack (email <a
        href="mailto:hello@mltshp.com">hello@mltshp.com</a> for an invite!) and <a
        href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1833082553635028/?ref=bookmarks">a Facebook group</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="membership_levels">What do the membership levels mean?</h2>
      <p>
        Membership is required to participate on MLTSHP, but it's a low bar! We'd love to have
        you aboard! These are the options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Non-members can see the Popular page and individual posts.</li>
        <li>
          The Single Scoop level ($3 per year) is a great way to check out the site. Members can:
          <ul>
            <li>Post images and videos to their own shakes and to group shakes, up to a
                monthly upload limit of 300MB for images and animated GIFs.</li>
            <li>Follow their friends' shakes, and follow and join group shakes.</li>
            <li>Save, like, and comment on any posts.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The Double Scoop level ($24 per year) can do all of the above, plus:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>There are no fixed upload limits.</strong></li>
            <li>Make up to 100 of their own group shakes.</li>
            <li>Get a little plus sign next to their name.</li>
            <li>Have RSS feeds for their shakes.</li>
          </ul>
          Even at just $2 per month, Double Scoop members cover the primary expenses of running
          MLTSHP and help make the Single Scoop level possible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We ran some numbers and determined that with our current membership, we could run the
        site if most users contributed $2/month. This includes things like paying for some storage,
        hosting and bandwidth (Fastly hosts our images, so great!), and someone to answer the odd legal
        question. We added a "bare bones" membership because we don't want
        anyone to be excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stripe handles the money stuff and the subscriptions. You can change or cancel your
        subscription type at any time from <a href="/account/settings">your account settings
        page</a>. You can pay more if you'd like. Paying more might help us make more stickers.
      </p>
      <p>We may want to talk if you're blowing up our bandwidth quota, but this is rarely an issue.</p>

              <h2 id="merch">Is there merch?</h2>
        <P>Yes! We have <a href="https://mltshp-store.creator-spring.com/">t-shirts</a> and we have <a href="https://www.stickermule.com/540c3f0decc8a7b/item/14743102">stickers</a>.</P>

      <h2 id="files">What can I upload or save?</h2>
      <p>
        You can upload JPG, GIF, or PNG files. You can post links to videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or Flickr.
      </p>

      <p>
        Image files should be a reasonable size. Be nice to your
        friends on mobile phones or tablets. Be nice to our bandwidth quota. There's a hard limit of 20MB per image.
      </p>

      <h2 id="shakes">What is a shake? How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        A shake is a curated collection of content. The creator of the shake is the owner and curator of
        the shake, approves new memberships, and can remove content. <a href="https://mltshp.com/tools/find-shakes">You can browse some shakes here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to contribute to a shake you don’t own, you can request to become a member. The shake
        owner will approve or deny your request.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you don’t want to contribute to a shake, but you want to see what is posted there, you can follow
        a shake.
      </p>

      <h2 id="alt-text">What is 'alt text'?</h2>
      <p>
        Alt text (or alternate text) is a description of an image that’s shown to people who can’t see the image, such as people with little or no vision, people who have turned off images to save data, and search engines. Please take a moment to add alt text when you upload new files. To learn more about how to write helpful alt text, check out <a href="https://axesslab.com/alt-texts/">Alt-texts: The Ultimate Guide</a> by Daniel Göransson.
      </p>

                <h2 id="shktakeover">I want to take over a shake that seems abandoned. What is the process?</h2>
<P>If the previous owner has left the shake (or did not make the transition from MLKSHK), an existing shake member can volunteer to be upgraded to owner. If there are no active members who want to take it on, the shake is deleted and can be re-created at the same URL. Contact us by email or Slack to request the change.</P>

      <h2 id="rules">Are there other rules here?</h2>
      <p>
        There is a <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> and a <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>
        that cover most of them. We want this to be a positive place for people. If it's not, we want people to
        let us know before it becomes a larger problem.
      </p>

      <h2 id="contact">How do I contact someone?</h2>
      <p>You can contact us directly by email
        at <a href="mailto:hello@mltshp.com">hello@mltshp.com</a>. We'll try to respond as quickly as possible.
      </p>

      <h2 id="bugs">What if I find a bug or have a feature request?</h2>
      <p>

        if you have a Github account), or use this
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK02m7I_lLPSBJ88pq8z1sQXF-WwKy0Cp_GnsI9zfeAtBaHA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">Issue
        Report Form</a>, or talk to people in realtime on
        our Slack (email <a href="mailto:hello@mltshp.com">hello@mltshp.com</a> for an invite!).

      </p>

      <h2 id="rss">How can I use RSS to follow the Best of MLTSHP account?</h2>
      <p>
        Using some magic, the <a href="/user/mltshp">MLTSHP</a> user saves some of the best
        images from the site. You can access that RSS feed with <a href="/user/mltshp/rss">this link</a>
        or follow the <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@best_of_mltshp@bird.makeup">@best_of_mltshp@bird.makeup bot</a> on Mastodon.
      </p>

      <!-- <h2 id="twitter">How can I use MLTSHP to host photos I tweet to Twitter?</h2>
      <p>
        First <a href="/tools/twitter">set up your Twitter account</a> to work with MLTSHP, after
        connecting you'll get a <a href="/tools/twitter/how-to">tutorial</a> on how to configure
        your phone.
      </p>-->

      <h2 id="plugins">Where can I get a plugin for Safari, Firefox, or Chrome?</h2>
      <p>
        Plugins <a href="/tools/plugins">can be found here</a>. If you'd like to make one, please
        email us and we can walk you through what we'd need.
      </p>

      <h2 id="password_reset">How do I change my password?</h2>
      <p>
        To reset your password, go to the <a href="/account/forgot-password">Lost Password page</a>
        linked from the sign in page. You will be emailed instructions on how to reset your password.
      </p>

      <h2 id="bad_password">Why are you giving me grief about my password?</h2>
      <p>
        We took
        <a href="http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time">a popular list of bad passwords</a>
        and match them against passwords being used to create accounts on MLTSHP and don't let you use them. Try again?
      </p>

      <h2 id="keyboard">Can I use keyboard commands for navigation?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! Here is what we support:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><kbd>h</kbd> - page down, <kbd>h</kbd> again navigates to "older"</li>
        <li><kbd>j</kbd> - next post, <kbd>j</kbd> at the end of the page navigates to "older"</li>
        <li><kbd>k</kbd> - previous post, <kbd>k</kbd> at the top of the page navigates to "newer"</li>
        <li><kbd>l</kbd> - page up, <kbd>l</kbd> again navigates to "newer"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="settings">What do the settings mean on the Settings page?</h2>

          <li><strong>Disable Email Notifications</strong> - MLTSHP will not send you email notifications with this selected.</li>
          <li><strong>Disable Video Autoplay</strong> - Videos will autoplay unless this is selected.</li>
          <li><strong>Remove NSFW Filter</strong> - Users can flag posts as Not Safe For Work. Those images require an additional click to view. Selecting this option means you will not have NSFW images filtered.</li>
