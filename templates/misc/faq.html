      <h2>What Is Going On Here?</h2>
      <p>
        MLTSHP is an approximate clone of the much-loved site MLKSHK created by Andre and Amber
        which <a href="http://waxy.org/2017/04/closing-communities-ffffound-vs-mlkshk/">closed
        in April of 2017</a>. We are 100% community funded and member-run. The site is
        subscription-based and is a registered corporation. <a href="https://github.com/MLTSHP/mltshp">The
        code is on Github</a> along with <a href="https://github.com/MLTSHP/welcome">a welcome
        module there</a> which talks about what is going on. There is also
        <a href="https://mlkshk-v2.signup.team/">a Slack</a> and
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1833082553635028/?ref=bookmarks">a Facebook group</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>What Do the Membership Levels Mean?</h2>
      <p>
        Membership is required to participate on MLTSHP, but it's a low bar! We'd love to have
        you aboard! These are the options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Non-members can see the Popular page and individual posts.</li>
        <li>
          Members at the Single Scoop level ($3 per year) can save, like, and comment on their
          friends' images, and upload their own image and video posts, up to a monthly upload
          limit of 300MB. It's a great way to check out the site.
        </li>
        <li>
          Members at the Double Scoop level ($24 per year) can do all of the above with no fixed
          upload limit* PLUS make up to 100 of their own shakes, get a little plus sign next to
          their name, and can have RSS feeds for their shakes. Even at just $2 per month, Double
          Scoop members cover the primary expenses of running MLTSHP, and help make the Single
          Scoop level possible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We ran some numbers and determined that with our current membership, we could run the
        site if most users contributed $2/month. This includes things like paying for storage,
        hosting, bandwidth, a business license, someone to do our taxes and answer the odd legal
        question we may have to ask. We added a "bare bones" membership because we don't want
        anyone to be excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stripe handles the money stuff and the subscriptions. You can change or cancel your
        subscription type at any time from <a href="/account/settings">your account settings
        page</a>. You can pay more if you'd like. Paying more might help us make stickers.
      </p>
      <p>We may want to talk if you're blowing up our bandwidth quota, but this is rarely an issue.</p>

      <h2>What Can I Upload or Save?</h2>
      <p>
        You can upload JPG, GIF, or PNG files. You can post links to videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or Flickr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Image files should be a reasonable size. Be nice to your 
        friends on mobile phones or tablets. Be nice to our bandwidth quota. There's a hard limit of 20MB per image.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Are There Other Rules Here?</h2>
      <p>
        There is a <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> and a <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>
        that cover most of them. We want this to be a positive place for people. If it's not, we want people to
        let us know before it becomes a larger problem.
      </p>
        
      <h2>How Do I Contact Someone?</h2>
      <p>You can contact us directly by email 
        at <a href="mailto:hello@mltshp.com">hello@mltshp.com</a>. We'll try to respond as quickly as possible.

      <h2>How Can I use RSS to Follow the Best of MLTSHP Account?</h2>
      <p>
        Using some magic, the <a href="/user/mltshp">MLTSHP</a> user saves some of the best 
        images from the site. You can access that RSS feed with <a href="/user/mltshp/rss">this link</a>
        or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/best_of_mltshp">@Best_of_MLTSHP</a> on Twitter.
      </p>

      <h2>How Can I Use MLTSHP to Host Photos I Tweet to Twitter?</h2>

        connecting you'll get a <a href="/tools/twitter/how-to">tutorial</a> on how to configure

      <p>
        To reset your password, go to the <a href="/account/forgot-password">Lost Password page</a>
        linked from the sign in page. You will be emailed instructions on how to reset your password.
      </p>
        
      <h2>Why Are You Giving Me Grief About My Password?</h2>
      <a name="bad_password"></a>
      <p>
        Given the recent news of password hijacking and fears about security, we took 
        <a href="http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time">a popular list of bad passwords</a> 
        and match them against passwords being used to create accounts on MLTSHP. Try again?
      </p>
        
      <h2>Can I Use Keyboard Commands for Navigation?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! Here is what we support:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>h - page down, h again navigates to "older"</li>
        <li>j - next post, j at the end of the page navigates to "older"</li>
