      <h2>What Is Going On Here?</h2>
      <P>MLTSHP is an approximate clone of the much-loved site MLKSHK created by Andre and Amber which <a href="http://waxy.org/2017/04/closing-communities-ffffound-vs-mlkshk/">closed in April of 2017</a>.

<h2>How Can I use RSS to Follow the Best of MLTSHP Account?</h2>
       <!--    IS THIS STILL A THING?  <p>
        The <a href="http://twitter.com/best_of_mltshp">@best_of_mltshp</a> account automatically
        tweets images that receive over 20 likes on MLTSHP. There is a site 
        called “<a href="http://shakefeed.com/">Shake Feed</a>” that converts these tweets to 
        an RSS feed you can <a href="http://shakefeed.com/rss">find here</a>.
      </p>-->
      <p>
        Using some magic, the <a href="/user/mltshp">MLTSHP</a> user saves some of the best 
        images from the site. You can access that RSS feed with <a href="/user/mltshp/rss">this link</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Are You Giving Me Grief About My Password?</h2>
      <p>

        <a href="http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time">a popular list of bad passwords</a> 
        and match them against passwords being used to create accounts on MLTSHP. Try again?
