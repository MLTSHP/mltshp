      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h2>What Is Going On Here?</h2>
      <p>MLTSHP is an approximate clone of the much-loved site MLKSHK created by Andre and Amber which <a href="http://waxy.org/2017/04/closing-communities-ffffound-vs-mlkshk/">closed in April of 2017</a>. 
        MLTSHP is volunteer run, subscription-based and is a registered corporation in Delaware. <a href="https://github.com/MLTSHP">The code is on github</a>. <a href="https://mlkshk-v2.signup.team/">There is also a Slack</a>.</p>
      <h2>What Do the Membership Levels Mean?</h2>
      <p>
        We ran some numbers and determined that with our current membership, we could run the
        site if users contributed $2/month. This includes things like paying for storage, hosting,
        bandwidth, a business license, someone to do our taxes and answer the odd legal question
        we may have to ask. We added a "bare bones" membership because we don't want anyone to be
        excluded. Stripe handles the money stuff and the subscriptions. You can change your
        subscription type at any time. You can pay more if you'd like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evereyone can save, like, and comment on your friends' images. Users at the Double Scoop
        level can also make up to 100 of their own shakes, get a little plus sign next to their
        name, and can have RSS feeds for their shakes.
      </p>
      <h2>What Can I Upload or Save?</h2>
      <p>
        You can upload JPG, GIF, or PNG files. You can post links to videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or Flickr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Image files should be a reasonable size. Be nice to your 
        friends on mobile phones or tablets. Be nice to our bandwidth.

      <h2>How Can I use RSS to Follow the Best of MLTSHP Account?</h2>
       <!--    IS THIS STILL A THING?  <p>
        The <a href="http://twitter.com/best_of_mltshp">@best_of_mltshp</a> account automatically
        tweets images that receive over 20 likes on MLTSHP. There is a site 
        called “<a href="http://shakefeed.com/">Shake Feed</a>” that converts these tweets to 
        an RSS feed you can <a href="http://shakefeed.com/rss">find here</a>.
      </p>-->
      <p>
        Using some magic, the <a href="/user/mltshp">MLTSHP</a> user saves some of the best 
        images from the site. You can access that RSS feed with <a href="/user/mltshp/rss">this link</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>How Can I Use MLTSHP to Host Photos I Tweet to Twitter?</h2>

      <h2>Why Are You Giving Me Grief About My Password?</h2>
      <p>
        Given the recent news of password hijacking and fears about security, we took 
        <a href="http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time">a popular list of bad passwords</a> 
        and match them against passwords being used to create accounts on MLTSHP. Try again?
