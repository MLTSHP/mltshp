    <b>TERMS OF USE</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    These Terms of Use (the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your use of this Internet website (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and your relationship with the owner/operator of the website, MLTSHP, LLC, a California limited liability company (referred to hereinafter as &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;our&rdquo;).  By using or accessing this website, you agree to these Terms.  We may at any time revise these Terms by updating this page. You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to review the then current Terms. By accessing and/or using the Site, you accept and agree to be bound, without limitation or qualification, by these Terms, and any modifications hereto. We may, in our sole discretion, immediately terminate your right to use the Site if we find that you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms or if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have in any way abused your right to use the Site.

  <p>
    1. <u>Privacy Policy</u>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you register with the Site, you are asked to provide certain personal information, including your name and email address (&ldquo;PI&rdquo;).  We store your PI, but do not provide it to any third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use this information to provide the services you request, send you notifications, respond to customer support requests, etc.  You can access and change your PI or delete your account by logging into your account here: <a href="http://new.mltshp.com/account/settings">http://new.mltshp.com/account/settings</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will not disclose, sell or exchange PI to or with anyone, without your approval, unless we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>comply with the law or legal process;</li>
    <li>protect or defend our rights or property, or the rights or property of others;</li>
    <li>enforce these Terms; or</li>
    <li>respond to claims that the content of any material on our system violates the rights of others.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    We will aggregate user information and perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our members and visitors, to measure overall demographics and interests regarding specific areas of our domain and to analyze how and where to use our resources. We share general demographic and interest information with third parties, but such aggregate information is not personally identifiable. We also use the aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors as to the number of people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement. In addition, we may compile and disclose aggregate information about our users for promotional or other purposes. For example, we might want to disclose that a certain percentage of our users are located within a particular geographic area or fall within a particular age range. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.  Cookies help us determine how long users view particular content, which particular content (e.g., advertising) users view, which content or sites users link to, and which services members and visitors use.  Persistent cookies are used if you choose to enable the auto-login feature. These cookies are randomly generated and uniquely assigned to each user. They are not associated with any personally identifiable information such as name or password. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Session cookies help us keep track of when a person is logged in. Once a user is logged in, session cookies allow us to personalize information on the Site for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will communicate with you via email, to the email address(es) you provide to us.  If you would like to cease receiving communications from us, you may either delete your account or notify us that you would no longer like to receive email communications from us by sending an email to this address, and informing us therein that you would no longer like to receive email communications: support@mltshp.com.
