      <p>
      I’m hunting down an error with the server, and the tens to hundreds of requests coming
      into incoming through automated robots is negatively affecting performance.
      </p>
      <p>
      I am shutting down incoming temporarily until I can figure out a way to keep the automated
      bots hitting the server so much. 
      </p>
      <p>
      If you are a bot writer, please consider using the API to make your requests.
